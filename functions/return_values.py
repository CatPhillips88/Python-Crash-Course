# Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. The function should take
# in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these pieces of information. Use the 
# function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries
# are storing the album information correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of songs on an album. If the 
# calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the album's dictionary. Make at least one new
# function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
